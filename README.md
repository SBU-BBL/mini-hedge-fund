This project implements a 12â€“2 momentum strategy using CRSP monthly stock return data from WRDS, running from August 2024 to May 2025. Stocks are ranked by their prior 12-month return excluding the most recent month, and the strategy invests equally in the top 10 percent each month. The portfolio is rebalanced monthly and compared to the S&P 500 Total Return Index over the same period. The project evaluates cumulative return, annualized return, volatility, and Sharpe ratio, and considers the influence of the 2024 U.S. presidential election cycle on market performance.
